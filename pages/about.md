## My Background üìñ

I'm a full-time software engineer working remote from a small island in the PNW.  Before my life in software I ran my own business and worked in business and sales.

Outside my life as a software engineer I help run a flower farm with my partner and her company [Keep Floral](https://instagram.com/keep.floral).  We started our journey getting out of the city at the start of 2020 before the pandemic started.  Our timing was very lucky to say the least!

## My journey üïπÔ∏è

I was first introduced to computers as a young child, my mother was quite the tech nerd in the 80s.  We had a PC and I got to play all the Sierra games which really sparked my fascination with computers.  Fast forward to my 12th grade when I enrolled in a programming class and learned some C++.  I knew I had a real love for programming but it was a bit late and I didn't have the necessary credentials to enroll in University to pursue computer science.

I spent my 20s going to marketing and business school and spent my time working as a sales rep for Pepsi.  At the time I realized my heart wasn't in it and that I would love to get back into tech.  But not before dabbling in entreprenuership of course, since both my parents had successful businesses growing up.  I had a go but the love for tech still called out at me.

In 2012 I found the opportunity of a lifetime at RESAAS, the company that I'm currently employed at, and my tech journey began.  I knew very little and they took the chance on me, the devs trained me and the company put me through some night courses.  Before you knew it I was an official Junior Software Engineer with a full-time job!

Fast forward to today and I've learned a load about deploying multi-tier applications, software patterns, architectual design, testing and more testing, CI/CD and the list goes on.  I personally think it says a lot about the company when you can be with them for this amount of time and still love going to work everyday.

## My entrepreneurial spirit üëï
Although I have a full-time job I still nourish my entrepreneurial spirit by dabbling in ecommerce and running my own online apparel brand.  

Emmma and I launched this brand for ramen lovers after a trip to Japan.  Since we both love ramen we figured that some apparel was needed so [Send Noods](https://sendnoods.shop/) was born. 

Currently hosted on Shopify and Etsy, it's been a lot of fun and great learning from marketing to understanding user-flows, SEO, UX and design.
