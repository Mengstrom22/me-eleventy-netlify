## My Background üìñ

I'm a software engineer working remote from a small island in the Pacific Northwest.  Before my life in software I ran my own business and worked in sales.

Outside my life as a software engineer I help run a flower farm with my partner and her company [Keep Floral](https://instagram.com/keep.floral).  We started our journey getting out of the city at the start of 2020 and now life a simple life in the country.  However I'm still very much connected and follow all the latest tech.

## My journey üïπÔ∏è

I was first introduced to computers as a young child, my mother was quite the techy in the 80s.  We had a machines from our first IBM x86 to the MSX where we played many games. We loved almost all the Sierra games published at the time which really sparked my fascination with computers.  However I didn't follow the traditional route of obtaining a CS degree.

I spent my 20s going to marketing and business school as I've always had a fascination with business.  Both my parents were successful entrepreneurs and it really inspired me to pursue my own business path.  I enrolled in a business and marketing program at BCIT and landed a job as a sales rep with Pepsi.  However, after a few years I knew sales wasn't for me.  As I searched for my next career path I decided to take a dive into running my own business, which lasted about 5 years when we decided to call it quits.  At that time I knew I had to go into tech, it was calling me.

In 2012 I found was presented with an amazing opportunity to join RESAAS as an aspiring software engineer.  The company was quite young at that time and they took a risk on me.  Fast forward to today and I still work there as a senior software engineer.  It goes without saying that I'm very happy I found RESAAS and chose this new career path. 

Today I'm part of an amazing team and my responsibilities include maintaining a multi-tier cloud application, architectual design, testing, maintaining APIs, working in a CI/CD environment and more.  

## My entrepreneurial spirit üëï
Although I have a full-time job I still nourish my entrepreneurial spirit by dabbling in ecommerce and help develop other projects on the side.  

Emmma and I launched this brand for ramen lovers after a trip to Japan.  Since we both love ramen we figured that some apparel was needed so [Send Noods](https://sendnoods.shop/) was born. 

Currently hosted on Shopify and Etsy, it's been a lot of fun and great learning from marketing to understanding user-flows, SEO, UX and design.
